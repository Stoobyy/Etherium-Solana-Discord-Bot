# Etherium and Solana Address Storing Discord Bot

This is a simple and ineffecient (but still working) discord bot that stores Etherium and Solana addresses. You can set a minimum balance for it the address to pass checking and you can also remove, view and export all addresses as json. This bot is pretty inefficient and basic as I am still new to python and discord.py so feel free to edit and make it better.

## THIS WAS A FIVERR ORDER THAT WE GOT SCAMMED ON
 
 My friend and I do [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/thehideout_) and we got this as an order by a very kind looking person. He paid a total of 15$ + 2 Nitro for this but he ended up scamming us and asking for a refund for both the Nitro and Fiverr money. He also was reselling our bot for 50$ per client which is a huge nono. We called him out and he got annoyed. Hence why we are open sourcing the bot.
#### The scammers go by the name NFTCop and they sell NFTs by the looks of their [website](https://nftcop.io). Feel free to do anything you want with this website and any social accounts that may be linked to this website. He has already done too much to us and I wouldn't mind him getting his scam business shut down.

## Frequently Asked Question (FAQs)

### Why open source a bot someone paid money for?
Answer. The guy who paid for it scammed me of the money and ran away with the bot code. He was also reselling it for personal profit without my consent and I cant really take any action against it because:
       i) I didn't license it or anything because I didn't think he would scam me 
       ii) I am not of age yet so can't really take much legal action.
       
### Why are there no more frequently asked question?
Answer. Idk you tell me

## Feel free to edit and make this bot better. I am also open to all suggestions and will probably need tips on how to progaram more effieciently.
